			<li>Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and numerous moons.
			<li> The Uranian system has a unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators.
			<li>In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant planets.
			<li> Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet.
			<li>Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007.Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).
