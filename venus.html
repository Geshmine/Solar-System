			<li>As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed.It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star". 
			<li>Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium BC. 
			<li>Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early interplanetary exploration.
			<li>It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2 in 1962), and the first to be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970).  
			<li>Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991.
