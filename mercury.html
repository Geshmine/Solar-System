			<li>Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). 
			<li>Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion.
			<li>Mercury's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.
			<li> Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.The polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). 
			<li>The planet has no known natural satellites.
