			<li>The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every 
second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat.  
			<li>When hydrogen fusion 
in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature 
while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. 
			<li>It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits 
of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable â€“ but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling 
star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.
			<li>The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times.The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity.
			<li>The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the 
basis of solar calendars, one of which is the Gregorian calendar, the predominant calendar in use today.
