			<li> There are investigations assessing the past habitability of Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life.
			<li> Liquid water on the surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth, except at the  lowest elevations for short periods. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice cap, if melted,would be sufficient to cover the planetary surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft).
			<li>Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish coloring.
			<li> Its apparent magnitude reaches âˆ’2.94, which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.
			<li>Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across when Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.
